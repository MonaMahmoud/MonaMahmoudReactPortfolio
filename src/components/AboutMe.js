            A self-motivated, creative, and ambitious full stack web developer holding a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering along with experience in high-profile corporations. Recently earned a certificate in full stack web development from Sydney University, with newly developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, Python, and responsive web design. I am always eager to apply strong analytical skills into the process of building integrated systems to provide reliable web experience.
I am confident in applying software development lifecycle methodology including implementation, testing, troubleshooting, and merging business applications. I am also dedicated and detail oriented, with the ability to work either as a team member or individually. In addition, I have profound planning, organization, prioritization, and problem-solving skills. I always take an enthusiastic approach towards new challenges, and Iâ€™m interested in learning new technologies.
